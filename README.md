**ðŸ”¹ [Flask Portfolio](https://mubashira.pythonanywhere.com/)**
A portfolio site with login, comments, and GitHub integration using Flask.

**About This Project**
This project is a beginner-level tutorial demonstrating how to build a Python Flask web application with database integration. The primary objective was to learn how to create a web app that includes a secure login system and allows logged-in users to post comments with timestamps and usernames.

You can explore the live app here: Mubashira on PythonAnywhere.

**Code Structure**
As this was a beginner tutorial and a small-scale project, the code organization is simple and not optimized for larger applications. Most of the functionality is contained within a single main application file (flask_app.py), alongside separate HTML template files.
